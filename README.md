This is an exercise involving writing code which takes in two txt files (user and tweet, both found in this directory), reads them, and formats them to the console in a predetermined format. I started off in Node, but abandoned it for Python. I created a working prototype in Python, but kept the Node version around in the hope of creating a frontend for it (and displaying to the page instead of console), making it a fullstack project.

I've divided the repo into subdirectories for each codebase: one for Python, one for Node, and another for the create-react-app I'm using for a possible frontend.
